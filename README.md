A game programming exercice

Just exploring several ways to recreate the Ping Pong game exercise proposed by https://robots.thoughtbot.com/pong-clone-in-javascript . First trial is based on a physical world metaphor. Second trial will be more event oriented. And so on, exploring various coding strategies for the sake of it.

Making this public to get feedback and suggestions on how to improve. I'm also looking for work.
