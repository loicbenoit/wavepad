A game programming exercice

Just exploring several ways to recreate the Ping Pong game exercise proposed by https://robots.thoughtbot.com/pong-clone-in-javascript . First trial is based on a physical world metaphor. Second trial will be more event oriented. And so on, exploring various coding strategies for the sake of it.

Making this public to get feedback and suggestions on how to improve. I'm also looking for work.

## Live examples

## Requirements
- A recent version of FireFox, Chrome, Edge or Safari (your browser must support some recent Javascript features).
- Will probably not work on IE (too old for modern Javascript). You should upgrade to FireFox, Chrome, Edge or Safari. Unless coding for a commercial project, I don't care for IE anymore. It's completely outdated and was replaced by Edge for a good reason.
